### Solutions

1. [Application Tutorial For Basics](ApplicationTutorialForBasics)

In this solution, some basic principles of AutomationML programming can be learned. The application provides a simple GUI so that the modelling results can be captured visually.

2. [Getting Started Samples](GettingStartedSamples)

This solution contains a collection of various programming examples, each covering a specific topic of AutomationML programming. 

3. [Examples from the Wiki](WikiSnippets)

This solution contains a collection of programming examples documented in the Wiki. The program communicates with the AutomationML editor using Interprocess Communication (IPC). 

4. [Advanced Application Tutorial](AdvancedApplicationTutorial)

This solution contains programming examples for advanced users. In the first version, the use of the AutomationML Library Service is demonstrated using sample requests.

### Code samples using the Aml.Engine

1. [Basic code snippets](basic.md) 
2. Examples according to [Document validation](validation.md).
3. Using the [Query service](queries.md).
4. Advanced document processing using [services](service.md).
5. Example project to [get started](GettingStartedSamples) with the Aml.Engine.
6. A [basic application](ApplicationTutorialForBasics), creating a tree view, representing a generated AutomationML document.
