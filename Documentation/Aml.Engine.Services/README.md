![Public class] | [CAEXSchemaTransformer][3]          | This class defines a service for a schema transformation. The service supports transformation of CAEX documents from CAEX Version 2.15 to version 3.0 and back. Backwards transformation can result in a loss of information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
![Public class] | [EmptyLookup&lt;TKey, TElement>][4] | Extension class which provides an empty lookup table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
![Public class] | [ExternalReferenceResolver][5]      | This class implements the [IExternalReferenceResolver][6] service interface. With this service it is possible to access CAEX objects which are outsourced into external documents and referenced using alias names. Normally the service is located by other services like query services. They can call this service to resolve an external reference if an alias is part of a CAEX path in any query.

![Public class] | [MergeService][8]                   | This class implements a merge service which is able to merge CAEX documents from different sources into one common document. The merge service adds the libraries from the external referenced file into the target document and updates all references, which use an alias and can be resolved after the merge. If a library, which is used in the external source, also exists in the target document, this library is replaced, if the library version in the external source is newer. If not the existing library is kept. If an InstanceHierarchy in the external source can be identified as an outsourced Master InternalElement, it is tried to add the Master InternalElement back to its original position. 
![Public class] | [QueryResult][9]                    | This class supports the interpretation of the queryResult table which is the result of some queries, defined in [IQuery][10]

![Public class] | [SplitService][18]                  | This class is an implementation of a split service. This service is able to split one [CAEXDocument][12] into multiple files using split points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
![Public class] | [UndoRedoService][19]               | This class implements an Undo and Redo service. When this service is registered, changes in an AutomationML document can be reversed. A sequence of actions can be grouped into transactions which than can be reversed within a single undo operation. The AMLEngine will locate a registered UndoRedoService and will notify the service of any changes, made to a document. The service manages individual stacks for each loaded CAEX document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
![Public class] | [UniqueNameService][20]             | This class defines methods for a unique name service. The names of CAEX-Objects in a Sequence of Elements should all be unique. If a unique name service is registered, the AMLEngine will automatically call this service for a unique name generation whenever a new element is added to a sequence which requires a unique name for its members. This services uses a generation pattern which consists of the specified default name followed by a generated ordinal number of the elements in a sequence.
